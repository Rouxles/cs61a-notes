# Contributors

- Written by Antonio Kam
- Some coding examples taken from Professor Fox's slides in [CS61A Fall 2021](https://cs61a.org).

## Want to contribute?

Make a pull request on the [GitHub](https://github.com/Rouxles/cs61a-notes/) repository. Specifically, edit the `docs` folder. It would be preferred if you installed Hugo (extended version) and compiled the website on your own machine before making the pull request (I haven't set up CI/CD yet), but it is completely fine if you do not know how to do that - it isn't too much additional effort for me.

I hope you enjoyed using this resource.
