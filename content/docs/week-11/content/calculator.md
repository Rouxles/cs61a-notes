## Compiled vs Interpreted

High Level Languages (basically languages with a lot of abstraction from machine code - essentially 1s and 0s) are typically either **compiled** or **interpreted**.

### Compiling

When a program is compiled, the source code is directly translated to machine code right from the start - this code can then be distributed and run repeatedly.

### Interpreted

When a program is interpreted, the source code is run directly without first compiling it. This gives interpreted languages more overhead, but also makes it such that you remove the time needed for compilation.

## Phases of an Interpreter

In order to interpret source code, programs need to be written to understand said source code.

A usual method is the following:

`Source Code -> Lexing -> Parsing -> Abstract Syntax Tree`
