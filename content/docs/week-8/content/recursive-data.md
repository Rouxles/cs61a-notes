# Recursive Data

## Linked Lists

Python lists are implemented in a way that makes inserting and deleting from the front of a list very inefficient. This is because Python implemented a list such that the first element of the list is always at the same memory location and elements in a list are located right next to each other, so when something is inserted to the start, everything gets pushed forward by one space in memory to make space for an element. 

A linked list allows very quick insertion to the start instead of using a list, so it has implications on efficiency.
