# Midterm 2

Welcome to your first CS61A Midterm! Please start revising early - it's a lot better spreading out your study over multiple days than to cram it all right before the exam. You'll learn more and more importantly, remember more (even in long term memory), setting you up to succeed more in future exams.

## Getting good at environment diagrams; now with mutation and classes

## Getting comfortable taking the recursive leap of faith

Getting used to this is one way to make recursive problems a lot easier to solve.
