# Welcome to CS61A!

Welcome to my CS61A Notes! This website will simply be a collection of notes/examples that I have found useful during UC Berkeley's CS61A course, and I hope that some information here can be helpful to somebody.

This is by no means a comprehensive guide on how to do well on CS61A, but rather just a place for me to write down notes and put down answers to practice questions.
