Eval # Base Case Primitive Values Recursive Case Evaluate(operator, operands) of call expressions Apply(procedure, arguments) Apply # Base Case Built in procedures Recursive Case User defined procedures Scheme specific traits # Nearly everything in Scheme is a list (as mentioned countless times); additionally, nearly everything in scheme is a call expression where the operator is evaluated, then the operands are all evaluated, then these operands are applied to the operator.</description></item><item><title>Tail Calls</title><link>https://cs61a.rouxl.es/docs/week-12/content/tail-calls/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cs61a.rouxl.es/docs/week-12/content/tail-calls/</guid><description>Tail Calls # Recursion Efficiency # Let&amp;rsquo;s take a look at a recursive and iterative implementation of a factorial function and see what the efficiency of it is.
# Recursive def recursive_factorial(n): if n == 1 or n == 0: return 1 else: return n * factorial(n - 1) # Iterative def iterative_factorial(n): total = n while n &amp;gt; 0: n -= 1 total *= n return total Both of these solutions take up O(n) time, but the iterative solution reuses the variables we have, while the recursive solution needs to keep opening up frames - in fact it opens up frames an O(n) number of times, causing this to have some space efficiency issues.</description></item></channel></rss>
