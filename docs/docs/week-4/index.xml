      <description>Recursion#Recursive Functions#A function is recursive if the body of the function calls itself (either directly or indirectly).
Recursive functions pretty much always lead to a base case by operating on increasingly smaller instances of the problem. A base case is the simplest case possible where a calculation can actually be done.
For example, a recursive function to sum the digits in a number can be written as below:</description>

      <description>Tree Recursion#Order of Recursive Calls#If you know the behaviour of environment diagrams, you could derive the behaviour of recursive calls.
Recaling how environment diagrams behave, a new frame is opened when a user-defined function call occurs, meaning that whenever a recursive function is called on a non-base case scenario, a new frame is opened, and that frame will be evaluated.
As a result, in a tree recursive return value (more on that later), for example recursive(3) + recursive(4), the whole value of recursive(3) is evaluated first before recursive(4) is evaluated (due to the order of operations of Python).</description>
