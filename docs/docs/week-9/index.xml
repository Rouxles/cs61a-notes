      <description>Efficiency#The efficiency of an algorithm is very important. While it isn&amp;rsquo;t too important in CS 61A due to the (relatively) small data set and number of computations needed, in big sets of data or some extremely computer taxing computations, efficiency makes a world of a difference in terms of actually being able to make computations.
However, CS 61A still wants you to understand how to calculate efficiency in a broad sense.</description>
