      <description>Trees#A tree is an abstract data structure (basically not implemented by default in Python), which means we need to use data abstractions in order to implement this structure.
What does a tree look like?#A tree has a root and a list of branches, where each branch is a tree itself.
A tree with zero branches (the white circles in the drawing above) is called a leaf.</description>

      <description>Mutability#Objects#An object is a bundle of data and behaviour, with each type of object called a class
Every value in Python is an object.
All objects have attributes, and objects often have associated methods

Strings have attributes (for example the data inside it) and also has methods such as string.</description>
