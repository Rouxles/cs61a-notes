      <description>Containers#Lists#A list is a container that can hold a sequence of information (usually related information).
Lists can hold any Python values (not the same behaviour in every language), including other lists/objects etc.
empty = [] # empty list B = [&amp;#34;Ben&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;Box&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;Bufy&amp;#34;] # Strings numbers = [2, 5, 7] # Integers floats = [2.0, 3.5, 7.5] # Floats nested = [[2, 3], 3, 4] # Storing a list inside a list mixed = [&amp;#34;Hi&amp;#34;, 2, 3.</description>

      <description>Sequences#Lists in Environment Diagrams#Lists can represented with box and pointer notation (similarly to functions); however, unlike functions, each element in the array has its own box, and is index labelled.
What this implies is that assigning a variable to another list will not create a copy of that list, but rather point towards the same list — this ends up being a correct assumption to make.</description>

      <title>Data Abstraction &#43; Dictionaries</title>

      <description>Data Abstraction#Many values in programs are compound values — a value composed of multiple values (for example coordinates, dates, or geographic positions)
By using a data abstraction, you can manipulate compound values as units without needing to worry about the way that values are stored.
Pair Abstraction#For data that is stored in pairs, we can manipulate these values using a pair data abstraction:
couple = pair(&amp;#34;a&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;b&amp;#34;) a = first(couple) b = second(couple) By implementing pair() (our constructor), first(), and second() (the selectors), you can access these elements without needing to worry about how the data is stored.</description>
