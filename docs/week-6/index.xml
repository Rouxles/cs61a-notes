What does a tree look like? # A tree has a root and a list of branches, where each branch is a tree itself.
A tree with zero branches (the white circles in the drawing above) is called a leaf.</description></item><item><title>Mutability</title><link>https://cs61a.rouxl.es/docs/week-6/content/mutability/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cs61a.rouxl.es/docs/week-6/content/mutability/</guid><description>Mutability # Objects # An object is a bundle of data and behaviour, with each type of object called a class
Every value in Python is an object.
All objects have attributes, and objects often have associated methods
Example (Strings) # A string is an object — try running type(&amp;quot;&amp;quot;) in Python console and seeing what it outputs.
Strings have attributes (for example the data inside it) and also has methods such as string.</description></item></channel></rss>
