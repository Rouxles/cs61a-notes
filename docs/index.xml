      <description>Control# Side Effects#Side effects occur in functions when the function alters the global environment in some form. This could be in the form of altering a variable in the global scope, or using a print statement inside a function. One easy way to tell if a function contains side effects is that if a function acts like a mathematical function, it has no side effects.</description>

      <description>Design#Abstraction#Abstraction (in a CS context) is broadly understood as extracting relevant information from other sources in order to simplify the codebase.
Abstraction by Parameterization#This is pretty much DRY (Don&amp;rsquo;t Repeat Yourself). Instead of hard-coding code that have similar structure, you could write a function that takes in parameters (arguments) which can be used to do the same thing. (Taken from CS61A Fall 2021 Design Slides)</description>

      <title>Introduction to the Basics of Python</title>
      <link>https://cs61a.rouxl.es/docs/week-1/content/introduction/</link>

      <description>The first week of CS61A is pretty simple - get used to your coding environment and a few of the basics of Python.
Lab 0#While this is optional, it&amp;rsquo;s probably best to do it just to get used to the very basics of Python as well as ok.py, the autograder used in CS61A.
You can (and should!) visualize how Python programs works with PyTutor or execute programs with code.</description>

      <title>Recursion</title>

      <description>Recursion#Recursive Functions#A function is recursive if the body of the function calls itself (either directly or indirectly).
Recursive functions pretty much always lead to a base case by operating on increasingly smaller instances of the problem. A base case is the simplest case possible where a calculation can actually be done.
For example, a recursive function to sum the digits in a number can be written as below:</description>

      <title>Decorators</title>

      <description>Decorators#Python decorators allow you to wrap functions inside one another easily. These may not be seen that often in the CS61A course, but in general, are pretty good to know due to the simplicity that it has as well as the common usage of it in web frameworks such as Flask, or in larger codebases.
Example Usage#Let&amp;rsquo;s take this trace function for example:
It returns a function that takes a single argument which traces the inputs and outputs of each function.</description>

      <title>Higher Order Functions</title>

      <description>Higher Order Functions#Designing Functions#Describing Functions#   Aspect Example     The domain of a function is the expected range of inputs (similarly to a domain in mathematics) x is a string.   The range of a function is the set of output values that could be returned Function square returns a non-negative number.   The behavior of a (pure) function is the relationship between the input and the output Function square returns the square of an input x.</description>

      <title>Environment Diagrams</title>
      <link>https://cs61a.rouxl.es/docs/week-2/content/environment/</link>

      <description>Environment Diagrams#Environment Diagrams are a good way to visualize how Python deals with its execution, and can also help you to visualize how more complicated pieces of code (e.g. Higher Order Functions) work.
PyTutor has a way of converting from code to environment diagrams, so please use that as a resource! The diagrams below are not going to match those from PyTutor exactly due to Markdown constraints, but I will try to emulate them as well as possible.</description>
