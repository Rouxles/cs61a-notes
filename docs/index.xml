      <description>Containers#Lists#A list is a container that can hold a sequence of information (usually related information).
Lists can hold any Python values (not the same behaviour in every language), including other lists/objects etc.
empty = [] # empty list B = [&amp;#34;Ben&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;Box&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;Bufy&amp;#34;] # Strings numbers = [2, 5, 7] # Integers floats = [2.0, 3.5, 7.5] # Floats nested = [[2, 3], 3, 4] # Storing a list inside a list mixed = [&amp;#34;Hi&amp;#34;, 2, 3.</description>

      <description>Control# Side Effects#Side effects occur in functions when the function alters the global environment in some form. This could be in the form of altering a variable in the global scope, or using a print statement inside a function. One easy way to tell if a function contains side effects is that if a function acts like a mathematical function, it has no side effects.</description>

      <description>Design#Abstraction#Abstraction (in a CS context) is broadly understood as extracting relevant information from other sources in order to simplify the codebase.
Abstraction by Parameterization#This is pretty much DRY (Don&amp;rsquo;t Repeat Yourself). Instead of hard-coding code that have similar structure, you could write a function that takes in parameters (arguments) which can be used to do the same thing.

      <description>Efficiency#The efficiency of an algorithm is very important. While it isn&amp;rsquo;t too important in CS 61A due to the (relatively) small data set and number of computations needed, in big sets of data or some extremely computer taxing computations, efficiency makes a world of a difference in terms of actually being able to make computations.
However, CS 61A still wants you to understand how to calculate efficiency in a broad sense.</description>

      <description>General Tips#No Prior Coding Experience#If you haven&amp;rsquo;t coded before starting this course, you can still succeed, but it will be quite significantly harder. CS61A is not an easy course at all (even for those with a lot of programming experience), so it&amp;rsquo;s very important to make sure that you understand how to think computationally.
To do this, make sure to go to office hours regularly if you ever feel unsure about homework/lab problems.</description>

      <description>Inheritance#Inheritance is a powerful tool that is very often used to reduce redundant code. If you have more specific versions of a larger class, inheritance can be extremely useful. Using our Animal class from the Objects notes, we can use all its general attributes, but then add more specific classes.
class Animal: default_food = [] def __init__(self, name, energy = 100): self.name = name self.food = self.default_food[:] self.</description>

      <title>Introduction to the Basics of Python</title>
      <link>https://cs61a.rouxl.es/docs/week-1/content/introduction/</link>

      <guid>https://cs61a.rouxl.es/docs/week-1/content/introduction/</guid>
      <description>The first week of CS61A is pretty simple - get used to your coding environment and a few of the basics of Python.
Lab 0#While this is optional, it&amp;rsquo;s probably best to do it just to get used to the very basics of Python as well as ok.py, the autograder used in CS61A.
You can (and should!) visualize how Python programs works with PyTutor or execute programs with code.</description>

      <guid>https://cs61a.rouxl.es/docs/week-7/content/iterators/</guid>
      <description>Iterators#What is an Iterator#An iterator is an object that provides sequential access to values in an iterable one by one.
While you may not see the use of them at the moment, the benefits of using them will be explained a bit later in these sets of notes.
 iter(iterable) returns an iterator over the elements of iterable. next(&amp;lt;iter&amp;gt;) returns the next element in an iterator.</description>

      <description>Recursion#Recursive Functions#A function is recursive if the body of the function calls itself (either directly or indirectly).
Recursive functions pretty much always lead to a base case by operating on increasingly smaller instances of the problem. A base case is the simplest case possible where a calculation can actually be done.
For example, a recursive function to sum the digits in a number can be written as below:</description>

      <guid>https://cs61a.rouxl.es/docs/week-11/content/scheme/</guid>
      <description>Scheme#Scheme is another programming language that CS61A can test. The reason why this is taught is not only because you make an interpreter for Scheme as your final CS61A project (where you write code in Python to essentially execute scheme code in Python - it&amp;rsquo;s really cool), but also because it&amp;rsquo;s essentially a practical way of showing that you&amp;rsquo;re able to quickly pick up other languages after you get comfortable with one.</description>

      <title>Tree Recursion</title>

      <guid>https://cs61a.rouxl.es/docs/week-4/content/tree-recursion/</guid>
      <description>Tree Recursion#Order of Recursive Calls#If you know the behaviour of environment diagrams, you could derive the behaviour of recursive calls.
Recaling how environment diagrams behave, a new frame is opened when a user-defined function call occurs, meaning that whenever a recursive function is called on a non-base case scenario, a new frame is opened, and that frame will be evaluated.
As a result, in a tree recursive return value (more on that later), for example recursive(3) + recursive(4), the whole value of recursive(3) is evaluated first before recursive(4) is evaluated (due to the order of operations of Python).</description>

      <guid>https://cs61a.rouxl.es/docs/week-6/content/trees/</guid>
      <description>Trees#A tree is an abstract data structure (basically not implemented by default in Python), which means we need to use data abstractions in order to implement this structure.
What does a tree look like?#A tree has a root and a list of branches, where each branch is a tree itself.
A tree with zero branches (the white circles in the drawing above) is called a leaf.</description>

      <guid>https://cs61a.rouxl.es/docs/week-3/content/decorators/</guid>
      <description>Decorators#Python decorators allow you to wrap functions inside one another easily. These may not be seen that often in the CS61A course, but in general, are pretty good to know due to the simplicity that it has as well as the common usage of it in web frameworks such as Flask, or in larger codebases.
Example Usage#Let&amp;rsquo;s take this trace function for example:
It returns a function that takes a single argument which traces the inputs and outputs of each function.</description>

      <guid>https://cs61a.rouxl.es/docs/week-7/content/generators/</guid>
      <description>Generators#What is a generator?#Generators can be used to create your own iterators with custom values. This is useful when you want to create an iterator with unpredictable results (for example numbers with irregular intervals, possibly based on different arguments in a given function).
The way you define a generator function is through the yield keyword (instead of return in a function). In this sense, a generator is a type of iterator that yields results from a generator function.</description>

      <description>Higher Order Functions#Designing Functions#Describing Functions#   Aspect Example     The domain of a function is the expected range of inputs (similarly to a domain in mathematics) x is a string.   The range of a function is the set of output values that could be returned Function square returns a non-negative number.   The behavior of a (pure) function is the relationship between the input and the output Function square returns the square of an input x.</description>

      <description>Macros#In Scheme, everything is a list. For example, (quotient 1 2) can also be seen as a Scheme list with the elements quotient, 1, and 2. What the &#39; operator lets us do in Scheme is create a list without evaluating certain options, then delay the evaluation until you need it later. For example:
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; (define lst (list &amp;#39;quotient 1 2)) lst &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; lst (quotient 1 2) &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; (eval lst) 0.</description>

      <description>Midterm 1#Welcome to your first CS61A Midterm! Please start revising early - it&amp;rsquo;s a lot better spreading out your study over multiple days than to cram it all right before the exam. You&amp;rsquo;ll learn more and more importantly, remember more (even in long term memory), setting you up to succeed more in future exams.

      <description>Mutability#Objects#An object is a bundle of data and behaviour, with each type of object called a class
Every value in Python is an object.
All objects have attributes, and objects often have associated methods
Example (Strings)#A string is an object — try running type(&amp;quot;&amp;quot;) in Python console and seeing what it outputs.
Strings have attributes (for example the data inside it) and also has methods such as string.</description>

      <description>String Interpolation#This is not part of representation, but is instead an extremely useful tool to make writing strings with multiple variables far cleaner. You may have already seen me use string interpolation earlier on in the course.
In Python, the cleanest way to use string interpolation is with an f-string, where the letter f is appended before quotation marks.
f&amp;#34;&amp;#34; You can see the syntax highlighting sees the f in a different colour!</description>

      <description>Sequences#Lists in Environment Diagrams#Lists can represented with box and pointer notation (similarly to functions); however, unlike functions, each element in the array has its own box, and is index labelled.
What this implies is that assigning a variable to another list will not create a copy of that list, but rather point towards the same list — this ends up being a correct assumption to make.</description>

      <guid>https://cs61a.rouxl.es/docs/week-12/content/tail-calls/</guid>
      <description>Tail Calls#Recursion Efficiency#Let&amp;rsquo;s take a look at a recursive and iterative implementation of a factorial function and see what the efficiency of it is.
# Recursive def recursive_factorial(n): if n == 1 or n == 0: return 1 else: return n * factorial(n - 1) # Iterative def iterative_factorial(n): total = n while n &amp;gt; 0: n -= 1 total *= n return total Both of these solutions take up O(n) time, but the iterative solution reuses the variables we have, while the recursive solution needs to keep opening up frames - in fact it opens up frames an O(n) number of times, causing this to have some space efficiency issues.</description>

      <description>Calculator Language#Compiled vs Interpreted#High Level Languages (basically languages with a lot of abstraction from machine code - essentially 1s and 0s) are typically either compiled or interpreted.
Compiling#When a program is compiled, the source code is directly translated to machine code right from the start - this code can then be distributed and run repeatedly.
Interpreted#When a program is interpreted, the source code is run directly without first compiling it.</description>

      <guid>https://cs61a.rouxl.es/docs/week-5/content/data-abstraction/</guid>
      <description>Data Abstraction#Many values in programs are compound values — a value composed of multiple values (for example coordinates, dates, or geographic positions)
By using a data abstraction, you can manipulate compound values as units without needing to worry about the way that values are stored.
Pair Abstraction#For data that is stored in pairs, we can manipulate these values using a pair data abstraction:
couple = pair(&amp;#34;a&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;b&amp;#34;) a = first(couple) b = second(couple) By implementing pair() (our constructor), first(), and second() (the selectors), you can access these elements without needing to worry about how the data is stored.</description>

      <description>Environment Diagrams#Environment Diagrams are a good way to visualize how Python deals with its execution, and can also help you to visualize how more complicated pieces of code (e.g. Higher Order Functions) work.
PyTutor has a way of converting from code to environment diagrams, so please use that as a resource! The diagrams below are not going to match those from PyTutor exactly due to Markdown constraints, but I will try to emulate them as well as possible.</description>

      <description>Objects#Object Oriented Programming (OOP)#OOP is a method for organizing programs. It includes
 Data Abstraction Bundling together related programs/information/behaviour  Each object can have its own local state (meaning its own variables), and also knows how to manage its own state.
OOP is particularly useful when you have many similar things that can be further generalized to avoid repeating redundant code. For example, you could have an Animal object, with other sub-classes of the Animal (for example, Turtle, Cat, Bear, etc.</description>

      <description>Recursive Data#Linked Lists#Python lists are implemented in a way that makes inserting and deleting from the front of a list very inefficient. This is because Python implemented a list such that the first element of the list is always at the same memory location and elements in a list are located right next to each other, so when something is inserted to the start, everything gets pushed forward by one space in memory to make space for an element.</description>
